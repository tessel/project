3 pin female header on power
- Provide power to the board via an external source
- Can Seeed to add that header for Sparkfun's items?

Windows 10 support
- This story needs to be tested and confirmed
- node-usb needs to be republished

Rahul's crash reporting tool
- Did a video chat with Jon
- Web UI which sees latest tickets, common stack traces, etc.
- We should evaluate the infrastructure needed for this

DHL issues
- Modules are processed by Whiplash already
- DHL is holding up another 14 boxes

TELEC update
- Partial successes so far
- Need a radically different test setup

Sweatshirt sizes
- Kelsey will poll team members

Restructure Twitter Start page
- Different companies want to be in our start experience
- We should invite companies to submit PRs as being part of our start experience
- Anyone can PR a template with their own web API
- Once we get a certain number, we should be cleverer about it
