> the firmware works for 20/40. Bad news is that they say it's not working for channel 12 & 13
> Also for TELEC it needs channel 14
> Channel 12/13 is used for CE
> Also they are saying that there are only two control modes b/g and n, and they want to control b & g separately. This could be an error in how I translated the testing instructions though
