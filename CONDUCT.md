Code of Conduct
===============

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

---

## Purpose

The core of the Tessel community is the people in it. Our primary goal is ensure this community is as inclusive to the largest number of people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or other personal characteristics of attendees.

We invite all those who participate in the Tessel project to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Tessel Community Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase community citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## Expected Behavior

 * Be kind, courteous, considerate, and respectful in your speech and actions. You are responsible for what you say and do.
 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  * Don't make assumptions about a person's background, abilities, or intentions.
  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech, including nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Expected Technical Behavior

In addition to the expected behavior outlined above, you are expected to adhere to the following precepts:

* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining code (e.g. "When the developer")

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech, actions, or microaggressions by any participant in our community at events, online, in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business, or at community related social events (such as a bar after an official event). Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial or sexual slights and insults. We consider microaggressions to be a form of harassment, and we will take appropriate action for incidences of microaggressions.

Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact us, as outlined in the Contact Info section below. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event). Individuals who have been banned are not allowed to attend Tessel events or participate in the Tessel project online, including forums, IRC, Github, and any other Tessel-related venues.

## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Full contact information is listed in the Contact Info section of this document. All communications will be kept strictly confidential, unless otherwise required by law. No issue will be considered too inconsequential or unimportant.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Governing Policy and Addressing Grievances

If you receive a temporary or permanent ban, your name and photo will be added to a private ban list. You will also be prevented from RSVP'ing to future Tessel events. If you receive a temporary ban, you will be notified once the ban has been lifted and you are allowed to rejoin the community.

If you have been banned and show up at an event, you will be escorted off the premises by community organizers. Local law enforcement may be contacted, at the organizers' discretion.

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify us with a concise description of your grievance at the email address listed under Contact Info. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our governing policies.
