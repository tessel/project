# Team Members

"Team Member" is a distinction and set of responsibilities that the Tessel Project Steering Committee can bestow on Project contributors.

## The title distinguishes someone who:
1. Has made a significant contribution of effort to the Tessel Project
2. Is capable of introducing someone new to the Project, whether that is showing them around the codebase or knowing who to point them to

## Responsibilities of a Team Member are:
* Create a blog post to introduce yourself to the community
* Commit to one or two "support weeks" per year where you take a first pass at any questions left unanswered on the Forums or Slack for more than a day (it's ok to pull in help if you don't know the answer)
* Make an effort to attend the annual Tesselcamp (virtually or in person)
* Be responsive and proactive in informing teammates about responsibilities you can no longer fulfill (e.g. signed up for a support week but realized it would be bad timing, or assigned self a bug/feature but don't have the time/knowledge to do it after all)
* You may occasionally receive a request for mentorship from a community member. If you do, either accept (with intent to have at least one call with them to introduce them to the project) or let them know you aren't able to take them on within a week.

## Privileges of a Team Member are:
* Commit access to the Tessel repos
* Access to write for the Tessel blog
* Moderator access on the Tessel forums
* Access to #team-members channel on Slack
* Reimbursement for Tessel Project-related expenses, such as hardware and shipping (Steering Committee must approve expenses above $50 USD)

# Guidelines for Team Members

## Getting started as a team member
A brief guide for new Team Members. :tada: Welcome to the team!

* **Your first PR as a Team Member** Officially add yourself as a Team Member. You can do so by opening up a Pull Request on the [tessel/project repo's  Team page](https://github.com/tessel/project/blob/master/TEAM.md). Check out [this PR as an example](https://github.com/tessel/project/pull/63).
* **Team Members on Slack** Join #team-members on Tessel Slack for discussion with your fellow Team Members.
* **Make a post** on the [Tessel Blog](https://github.com/tessel/this-week-in-tessel) introducing yourself to the community. [Here are some suggestions for an introductory blog post.](https://github.com/tessel/this-week-in-tessel/issues/24)
* **Get to know your mentor.** Your mentor is the Steering Committee member who asked you to become a Team Member. Schedule a call with them to get up to speed on Project priorities and to schedule your Support Week.

## Approving or rejecting modifications to assets (such as bug fixes, code refactoring, or minor API or feature changes)

1. A change request is received (PR, RFC, etc.).
1. Within a week, a TM should be assigned to respond either automatically or manually by another TM.
1. If TMs cannot come to an agreement on approval or rejection, an involved TM should make an issue [here](https://github.com/technicalmachine/tessel-project/issues) tagged ‘sc-agenda’ for discussion by the SC.

Guidelines:

1. If you're not sure about something, pull in someone else to help review. Check the repo's contributor graph (repo url/graphs/contributors) to find someone familiar with the repository.
1. Two (or more) Collaborators should agree to approve or reject anything major.
1. Allow an adequate amount of time (two days is suitable) for discussion before merging/closing.

## Managing feature requests and RFCs

1. Discussion of major new features should take place on the [RFC repo](https://github.com/tessel/rfcs) for each particular addition. These can be proposed by anyone.

## Maintaining strong communication with the community

### Support

1. A support request is received on the forums.
1. Within a week, if no one from the community has resolved the question, a TM should respond.

### Blog Posts

TMs are encouraged to post new features or interesting facets of the project to the blog. Please make a PR to [this repo](https://github.com/tessel/this-week-in-tessel) with your post!

## Ensuring open and respectful discourse

If a member of the community is unkind or disrespectful, TMs should encourage more constructive discourse by responding politely, kindly, and respectfully. Do not engage in a flame war.

TMs should review the [Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md) and ensure that it is followed. Harassment/abuse/etc. should be brought to the attention of the SC as outlined in the Code of Conduct. The SC will take appropriate action to ban abusive members.
