## Approving or rejecting modifications to assets (such as bug fixes, code refactoring, or minor API or feature changes)

1. A change request is received (PR, RFC, etc.).
1. Within a week, a TM should be assigned to respond either automatically or manually by another TM.
1. If TMs cannot come to an agreement on approval or rejection, an involved TM should make an issue [here](https://github.com/technicalmachine/tessel-project/issues) tagged ‘sc-agenda’ for discussion by the SC.

Guidelines:

1. If you're not sure about something, pull in someone else to help review. Check the repo's contributor graph (repo url/graphs/contributors) to find someone familiar with the repository.
1. Two (or more) Collaborators should agree to approve or reject anything major.
1. Allow an adequate amount of time (two days is suitable) for discussion before merging/closing.

## Managing feature requests and RFCs

1. Discussion of major new features should take place on the [RFC repo](https://github.com/tessel/rfcs) for each particular addition. These can be proposed by anyone.

## Maintaining strong communication with the community

### Support

1. A support request is received on the forums.
1. Within a week, if no one from the community has resolved the question, a TM should respond.

### Blog Posts

TMs are encouraged to post new features or interesting facets of the project to the blog. Credentials to the technical.io blog (Tumblr) will be shared with TMs and they should feel free to post any time. Kelsey ([@selkeymoonbeam](//twitter.com/selkeymoonbeam)) is happy to review and offer suggestions on any posts prior to publishing.

## Ensuring open and respectful discourse

If a member of the community is unkind or disrespectful, TMs should encourage more constructive discourse by responding politely, kindly, and respectfully. Do not engage in a flame war.

TMs should review the [Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md) and ensure that it is followed. Harassment/abuse/etc. should be brought to the attention of the SC as outlined in the Code of Conduct. The SC will take appropriate action to ban abusive members.
