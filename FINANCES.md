# Finances

The Tessel project is a member of the Bocoup Foundation, which handles its public funds. These funds are generated in a few ways:

1. We receive royalties from our manufacturing partners, usually a few percentage points of each product sold.
2. We generated money through Amazon referral links for hardware, for example [our hardware modules](http://github.com/tessel/hardware-modules) recommendation list.
4. We receive money through partnerships or sponsorships with companies.

We also receive donations directly through [Tessel's Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/tessel).

## What these funds are used for

The Tessel Project has no payroll and is staffed entirely by volunteers. We approve the use of funds by vote of the Steering Committee. Funds are allocated broadly for a few uses:

1. Server hosting and domain names.
1. Purchasing of hardware directly from manufacturing partners for use in hackathons, advertisements, conferences, or direct engagement with customers or team members. Expenses of this type can be submitted through the [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/tessel)
2. Equipment for the testing and validation of hardware. For example: micro USB cables, Tessels, and Tessel modules may be purchased to diagnose a specific hardware issue occurring under circumstances we need to recreate in-house. Another example is the purchase of logic or radio analyzers, which are usually shared within the team.
3. In limited quantities, we may purchase swag to reward project contributors.
4. The funding of additional R&D, when required. For example: if the Tessel Project moves forward with a new module, we may need to fund the purchase of a breakout board or potentially a prototype board.
5. In some circumstances, we may fund contracting work done by individuals, depending on the urgency of the work being done.

### Reimbursements

Funds received by Open Collective can be spent in the form of reimbursements to contributors or team members. You can submit an expense via receipt through the [Open Collective Expense Form](https://opencollective.com/tessel/expenses). Please e-mail team@tessel.io concerning any expenses you would like approved. We may direct you to use this form for purchases made on behalf of the project.

## Funding Potential

The Tessel Project can directly approve funding for tools, R&D, and bug/feature bounties. Please [submit an RFC](https://github.com/tessel/rfcs) to suggest any of these.
